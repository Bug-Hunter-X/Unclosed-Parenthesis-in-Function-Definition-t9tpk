This repository demonstrates a common Python error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version.  The error results in a `SyntaxError`. The solution involves simply adding the missing closing parenthesis.
